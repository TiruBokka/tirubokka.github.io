I, **Tiru Bokka**, am a techie curious about **technology**, **tools**, [**theology**](https://www.bible.com), and [**Telugu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language). Upon accepting Jesus Christ as my Savior, I was given the name  **Timothy Bokka**.

I co-founded and run a technology company named [**Spoors**](https://spoors.in/) that builds an award-winning SaaS **Toolkit for Enterprise Activity Management** as its **CTO**.

Here is a partial list of tools and technologies that I explore:

* Mobile Platforms ([Android](https://www.android.com) and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/))
* Operating Systems ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/))
* Programming Languages ([Java](https://www.java.com/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), and [Swift](https://swift.org/))
* Databases ([MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/))
* Development ([Shell Scripting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Web Development](https://spring.io/))

I am a [BTCP](https://bibletraining.com) graduate, and I do live traslation of Bible messages from English to Telugu almost every Sunday, and preach Bible messages whenever I can. My messages have been published as 2 Kindle eBooks:

* [Quiet Retreat, Volume 1: Devotions](http://a.co/bDgAuVw)
* [Quiet Retreat, Volume 2: Sermons on Edification](http://a.co/51KUABx) 

I hope the content that I post on this blog useful for many people.
